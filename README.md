# PyCembler
A C++ compiler for Python code

To use, place your Python file named "input.py" in the same directory as "main.py" and run "main.py"

Can only work with primative data types (except void). No IO/classes/function calls/etc.
Will start accepting pull requests once the module identification system is in place.
