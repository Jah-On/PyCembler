# PyCembler
A Python to C++ Converter

To use, place your Python file named "input.py" in the same directory as "main.py" and run "main.py"

Can only work with primative data types (except void). No IO/classes/function calls/etc.
Will start accepting pull requests once the module identification system is in place.
